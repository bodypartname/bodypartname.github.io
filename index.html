  "articleBody": "The human body is made up of different body parts or organs that are present inside our body and work to help us live a healthy life. There are many organs in our body that together form a system called an organ system. Tissues are organized to form various body organs like the heart, kidney, lungs, etc. An organ may be formed from different types of tissue arranged together in a peculiar manner. As children grow up, they become curious to know the names of their body parts and how they work. In this article, we have covered the list of body parts names in English and the list of internal and external body parts names with pictures. Body parts for Kids The human body is made up of many organs. Each organ of our body has a different shape and size, and their functions are also different. Like the function of the kidney is to filter the blood, similarly every organ performs different functions.

The heart is divided into four chambers. Each chamber is separated by valves that direct the flow of blood. kidney: Kidneys remove waste products from the blood and expel them through urine and control your blood pressure. The kidneys are a special filter system for your body and control the levels of many substances in the blood. Liver: The liver is a vital organ in the human body with many essential functions, including detoxification, metabolizing drugs, processing food nutrients, regulating body metabolism, blood clotting, metabolism of nutrients (carbohydrate, fat, protein metabolism), storage of nutrients, blood clotting, synthesis of plasma proteins, and breakdown of hemoglobin. Stomach: The stomach is a very important part of the digestive system. It holds the food and mixes acids and enzymes for the breakdown of food. Its main functions are storage of food, secretion of digestive juices, mechanical digestion, absorption, and regulation of food movement. Lungs: The lungs are essential organs in the respiratory system, responsible for the process of gas exchange. When you breathe, air enters your lungs, and oxygen from that air moves into the blood, and carbon dioxide, a waste gas, moves from your blood into the lungs and out. External and Internal Body Parts Name List of External Body Parts with Location The human body is a complex structure; understanding the location of these body parts is essential to learning anatomy, increasing body awareness, and improving communication about health and fitness. Below is a comprehensive list of external body parts classified based on their location on the body.

<p><b>Stomach: </b>The stomach is a very important part of the digestive system. It holds the food and mixes acids and enzymes for the breakdown of food. Its main functions are storage of food, secretion of digestive juices, mechanical digestion, absorption, and regulation of food movement.</p>
<p><b>Lungs: </b>The lungs are essential organs in the respiratory system, responsible for the process of gas exchange. When you breathe, air enters your lungs, and oxygen from that air moves into the blood, and carbon dioxide, a waste gas, moves from your blood into the lungs and out.</p>
